    <h1>Kimchi</h1>
    <img src="../kimchi.png" alt="Kimchi">
    <p> It’s usually a combination of a main vegetable (like Napa cabbage or a radish), garlic, ginger, chile powder, salt, and a salted seafood or fish sauce. The most popular version is baechu kimchi, which is made from Napa cabbage, but there are nearly 200 “official” varieties in Korea!

        In this quick version, the cabbage is chopped into bite-sized pieces and mixed with the seasoning. The result is an easy kimchi with still a bit of bite, and all the salty, sour, spicy, and pungent flavors you’d expect from a vegetable pickled with fish sauce and garlic. </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>  1 (4 pounds) Napa cabbage, cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch pieces</li>
<li>    1/4 cup coarse sea salt
</li>
<li>    1 (1 pound) Mu or Daikon radish, shredded (about 1 cup)
</li>
<li>    4 scallions, cut into 2-inch lengths
</li>
<li>    1/2 cup Korean chili powder (gochu galu)
</li>
<li>    6 to 8 garlic cloves (1/4 cup), minced
</li>
<li>    1 tablespoon minced or grated ginger
</li>
<li>    1 tablespoon sugar
</li>
<li>    3 tablespoons fish sauce
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li> Place the cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle the salt over it. Mix until combined and add water until just covered (about 3 cups). Let sit for 2 hours, mixing it a couple of times to be sure it is salted evenly, and the cabbage has gone limp. </li>
    <li> Reserve 1 cup of the salt water and set it aside (you may not need to use it, but its good to have it just in case). Drain the remaining water from the cabbage and rinse well with cold water. Place the cabbage back into the same large bowl. </li>
    <li> In another large mixing bowl, add the radish, scallions, garlic, ginger, chili powder, sugar, and fish sauce. Use your gloved hands to fully combine the ingredients. </li>
    <li> Using gloved hands, massage the flavor into the cabbage and mix well until all of the cabbage is covered in the seasoning. </li>
    <li> Pack the cabbage mixture into 2 quart-sized glass jars, pressing down to get rid of any air bubbles and to pack tightly. Pour a little bit of the reserved salty water to cover the cabbage and leave an inch of headspace to allow for expansion. </li>
    <li> You can place the kimchi in the refrigerator right after packing the jars to ferment or a milder flavor or you can leave it on the counter in a cool, dark place with the lids slightly ajar for up to two days before transferring it to the refrigerator for a stronger flavor.

        Once two days have passed or you’ve opened the jar, place it in your refrigerator. </li>
    <li> Serve on the side of any Korean meal with rice or salad. </li>
</ol>
